Recycling
===========

**Recycling** is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions (compared to plastic production, for example). Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling).
    
Singapore's integrated solid waste management system focuses on two key thrusts â€“ waste minimisation and recycling, or simply the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). In land-scarce Singapore, waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration plants offer the best technical solution by reducing waste volume efficiently to conserve landfill space. The 3Rs play a crucial role by preventing waste generation at its source and bringing along numerous benefits.

We will work towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation by reducing our consumption, as well as reusing and recycling all materials to give them a second lease of life.
